# Why I'm an outsider

* I'm not from the USA, Scandinavia, or the UK, where the prison abolition movement
  is more well-known

* I've never been a prisoner or worked in the criminal justice system

* I'm an empiricist and a quantitative methodologist

* I'm a bit sceptical of some claims prison abolitionists have made (more on
  this later)

* I'm a strong supporter of prison reform, but new to the prison abolition
  literature

# However...

* I love to meet people who have bold and original ideas

* I think we do need more "moonshot projects"

* I truly believe that honest, open debates with those who disagree with you
  are necessary 

* I'm open to change my mind when presented with compelling evidence or
  normative arguments

* I'm really thankful for the invitation and I hope to learn from you all
  today!

# The case for prison abolition

---

# Brief overview

* Contemporary discussions to abolish prisons started in the 1970s in
  Scandinavia ([Mathiesen, 1974](https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Abolition-Revisited-Thomas-Mathiesen/dp/1138021253)) and the USA ([Knopps, 1976](https://www.amazon.com/Instead-Prisons-Abolitionists-Honey-Knopp/dp/B000OO9KP8))

* Most scholars advocating for prison abolition currently take the American
  prison system as an example (e.g., [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/))

* Five main points:
  - The prison-industrial complex is the modern equivalent of slavery
  - Imprisonment oppresses minorities and strengthen the capitalist
    regime
  - Resources used to maintain prisons should be spent in welfare, where they
    are more effective
  - Local communities can and should be responsible for public safety
  - Criminalisation does not address the needs of the interested parties

# Abolitionism is attracting interest the mainstream

* Articles discussing prison abolitionism have appeared in [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2020/08/the-abolition-movement), [GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/what-is-prison-abolition), [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/magazine/prison-abolition-ruth-wilson-gilmore.html), [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/what-is-prison-abolition/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/18/903546893/the-movement-to-abolish-prisons-and-the-police), and [Teen Vogue](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-prison-abolition-movement)

* Growing academic literature on the topic 
  - ~3,000 articles with "prison abolition" in the title ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q="prison+abolition"&btnG=))


* In the wake of recent episodes of racial violence in the US, there has been a
  surge in social media posts about prison abolition, too ([#prisonabolition](https://twitter.com/hashtag/prisonabolition?src=hashtag_click))

# Three sceptical takes on prison abolition

---

# Three sceptical takes

* **First take**: There are "crimes" and *crimes*

* **Second take**: There is a supply of harsh punishment because there is a strong
  demand for it, and the demand should be taken seriously

* **Third take**: There is little empirical evidence in the academic literature on
  prison abolitionism, whereas other public policies that reduce incarceration,
  such as deterrence, show reliable results

---

# How to test prison abolitionism empirically?

* The discussion on abolitionism has thus far only focused on theoretical and
  normative arguments

* However, the public and policy-makers may require more evidence in that
  regard

* Randomised experiments are unethical, illegal, and impopular

* How could we approximate how a world without prisons could be?

--

* One way of doing so is to look at communities in which incarceration is
  infeasible 

---

# How to test prison abolitionism empirically?

* In many places, the state is either unable or unwilling to act

* Two relevant cases: *prison gangs* and *vigilante groups*

* Prison gangs, paradoxically, are one of such cases: they are created to
  regulate inmate affairs that are beyond the scope of the state
  
* Most developing countries have areas in which the state has only
  imperfect monopoly on the use of force, so vigilante groups themselves punish criminals

* In both cases, incarcerating individuals is not an option, either because
  they are _already_ in prison, or because there are no prisons available

# "Crimes" and *crimes*

* The literature sometimes mention "crimes" in inverted commas to question the validity
  of the accusations

* They have a point: Many would agree that drug possession or traffic
  infractions should not be punished with incarceration

* However, how would prison abolitionists deal with *crimes*, the ones which
  society largely believes are strongly immoral?
  - Gang rape, child pornography, cannibalism, torture, serial killings

--

* How do societies without the possibility of incarceration deal with serious
  crimes?

---

# Prison gangs

* Prison gangs have strict codes of behaviour, often in the form of written
  constitutions

* Punishment for serious crimes, such as torture or rape, is generally death

* Some prison gangs, like Brazil's _Primeiro Comando_, also have "crime
  courts", where the accused can defend themselves

* Their punishment is still much more violent than that of the state

* Prison gangs also use "communicative violence", where the type of punishment
  itself is used to send a signal to other members

---

# Vigilante groups

* Vary greatly in size and scope

* In developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil, lynchings are a common
  form of vigilante punishment

* From 2011 to 2015, Brazil registered about 2,500 lynching episodes, and in
  2015 alone 173 people were killed by angry mobs, an average of one execution
  every two days

* Victims are generally accused of petty theft, and many are beaten to death
  for stealing mobile phones, cooking utensils, or pairs of sandals 

* Lynching perpetrators are often young men, but they also include female
  teenagers, elderly women, and even members of local police forces 

---

# Supply and demand for punishment 

* Lynchings happen more often where the police is unreliable, prisons
  unavailable, or people distrust the criminal justice system for being too
  lenient with criminals

* In my research in Mexico, more democratisation leads to _higher support for
  lynchings_

* Citizens are not afraid of police abuse, but fear that criminals will be out
  for a long time before their cases are closed

* Citizens in Mexico and in Brazil do not show interest in restorative justice,
  as suggested the prison abolitionists

* Police Colonel Fernandes, in SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil): "_we try to find the
  criminals before the people do. The strongest law in poor communities is the_
  lex talionis: _an eye for an eye_"

---

# Supply and demand for punishment 

* Psychology experiments also suggest that proximity and knowledge are poor
  substitutes for the desire of revenge

* Dictator games consistently show that players prefer to make zero profits
  than allowing others to take most of the gains unilaterally. The effect is
  larger for players from less industrialised countries (see [Tisserand et al
  (2015)](https://motamem.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ultimatum-meta-analysis-1.pdf)
  for a meta analysis)

* Social punishment often goes beyond the severity of the crime: it serves a
  symbolic purpose

* [Gambetta
  (2011)](https://www.amazon.com/Codes-Underworld-How-Criminals-Communicate/dp/0691152470)
  shows that criminals use mutilations to send signals to third parties;
  [Martins
  (2015)](https://www.amazon.com/Linchamentos-Justia-Popular-no-Brasil/dp/8572448918)
  argues that lynchings have the main purpose of dehumanising the victim, not
  to punish the crime per se

---

# Reducing incarceration with deterrence policies

* If prison abolition is difficult at the moment, other policies may help
  reduce the number of inmates in many countries

* The most widely-known is to decriminalise minor offenses
  - Drug use, illegal gambling, traffic violations

* However, deterrence policies also seem to work in even for serious crimes

* Deterrence policies are those that discourage criminal activities

* They are based on the _threat_ of sanctions rather than punishments
  themselves

---

# Reducing incarceration with deterrence policies

* [Gary Becker (1968)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830482) formulated the
  modern version of the theory

* [Braga et al (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12353), in a recent
  systematic review, "demonstrate that focused deterrence strategies are
  associated with an overall statistically significant, moderate crime
  reduction effect"

* The effect is particularly large for variants that try to dissuade groups to
  engage in violence ([RAND (2020)](https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL261/better-policing-toolkit/all-strategies/focused-deterrence/in-depth.html))

* Deterrence policies do not argue to abolish prisons, but their effect leads
  to a reduction of incarceration rates

---

# Reducing incarceration with deterrence policies

* They work even in situations where the state is not present and in countries
  which had suffered civil wars (see [Blattman et al (2017)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150503))

* While deterrence seems to fall short of the expectations of prison
  abolitionists, it may serve as a good start to bring the discussion to a
  wider public

# Humble suggestions to move the prison abolition discussion forward

---

# Wrapping up

* Prison abolition is a noble goal, but it may not be feasible

* Serious crimes remain an issue for prison abolition

* Current evidence indicates that societies without prisons are more violent
  that those which use incarceration methods

* The demand for punishment is real and may not be supplemented by restorative
  justice

* Other policies may reduce incarceration rates more rapidly

---

# A few ideas for further discussion

* Maybe prison abolition should be understood as an "unfinished" movement, and
  "_thus conceive of struggles as being unending, without finality_" ([Carrier
  and PichÃ© (2015)](https://doi.org/10.4000/champpenal.9162))

* While this approach is probably unsatisfying for some, it can equate
  prison abolitionists' demands with the hard questions the movement still
  faces

* Historical examples where prisons were abolished or non-existent can also
  benefit the arguments prison abolitionists make

* Abolitionists can also look for "low-hanging fruits" in criminology,
  sociology, and economics: Many policies that have strong evidence in their
  favour may not pass into law because of lack of public mobilisation

---

# A few ideas for further discussion

* Tackling the demand for punishment is hard, and sometimes a top-down approach
  is more effective
  - The abolition of the death penalty was "_a countermajoritarian reform, imposed with limited popular support and usually in direct contravention of majority public opinion_" [(Garland, 2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Peculiar-Institution-Americas-Penalty-Abolition/dp/0674066103)


* Activists have found support from groups across the political spectrum,
  specially right-wing libertarians, yet mass public support for abolishing
  prisons from serious crimes will be difficult

--

* These challenges are not small, but we need to face them if we want to move
  beyond return
